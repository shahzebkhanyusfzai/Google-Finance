Scrape Google Finance with Python - Selenium

Hey Data Enthusiasts, I have created this python selenium Scraper for Google finance, 
It helps in scraping the google finance Time series data
In the current form, it scrapes the end date Price of a ticker, 
The current script is a complete tailer made solution for a client, but you can twist it as per your needs

Scraping Google finance data is easy except if youre scraping the time series data, and the peculiar part of this repository is that if pulls the data by automating the cursor action on the tickers hisotrical graph via selenium
